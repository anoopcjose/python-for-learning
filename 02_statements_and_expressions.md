### Statements & Expressions
A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.

```commandline
print(1 + 1)
2
```

### Assignment Operation (=)
Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand
```commandline
x = y + z
```
### Add and Assign (+=)
Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand
```commandline
a += b
```
### Subtract and Assign (-=)
Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand: True if both operands are equal
```commandline
a -= b
```
### Multiply and Assign (*=)
Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand
```
a *= b
```

### Divide and Assign (/=)
Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand
```commandline
a /= b
```

### Modulus and Assign (%=)
Takes modulus using left and right operands and assign result to left operand
```commandline
a %= b
```

### Divide(floor) and Assign (//=)
Divide left operand with right operand and then assign the value(floor) to left operand
```commandline
a //= b
```

### Exponent and Assign (**=)
Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand
```commandline
a **= b
```

### Performs Bitwise AND on operands and assign value to left operand (&=)
```commandline
a &= b
```

### Performs Bitwise OR on operands and assign value to left operand (|=)
```commandline
a |= b
```

### Performs Bitwise xOR on operands and assign value to left operand (^=)
```commandline
a ^= b
```

### Performs Bitwise right shift on operands and assign value to left operand (>>=)
```commandline
a >>= b
```

### Performs Bitwise left shift on operands and assign value to left operand (<<=)
```commandline
a <<= b
```
